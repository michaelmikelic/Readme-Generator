# Readme-Generator
This application will ask a series of questions in the terminal prompt and then with the data create a ReadMe file with the title of your project with sections for: Description, Installation, Usage, License, Contributing, Tests, and Questions.  

Once you run the nobe index.js file in your terminal, a new ReadMe file will automatically be generated and will be located in the 'dist' folder.
